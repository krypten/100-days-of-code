# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 4, 2017
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Added the code to shuffle and also plotting the normal distribution.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with ploting the relative frequency on the histogram but finally found out the way using matplotlib.

### Day 0: March 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added sampling and histogram ploting code to this [repository](https://github.com/krypten/PlayingCardsStatisticalAnalysis).

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with gglot and matplot, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting hang of it. Plotting is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
